NOTE: Features marked with (*) are in the works.

## Setup
There's a default key for data encryption in database in cryptograhic_key.php. Change this key later on if you plan to upload the code to any hosting.

Control panel access user is "admin" and password "admin", without the quotes.

Remember to change your settings in connection.php and email_settings.php after your have exported the database in your machine.

In order to make everything work, you'll need to do the following.

Move cryptograhpic_key.php, connection.php and email_settings.php outside your website's root folder (at same directory level). This is because theese files have to be in a non public accesible location.

Copy all the content inside public_html into the root of your website's root folder.

You may see some missing elements until you populate the website with contents.
