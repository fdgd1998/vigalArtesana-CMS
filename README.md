# vigalArtesanos-CMS
This is a small, custom CMS developed from scratch for my mother's carpentry and restoration company.

The main purpose of this CMS is to show company information, as well as providing a showcase where the work done can be exposed. A basic control panel is also made to manage website's content.

Programming languages used: HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and MySQL.

Current features:
- Encryption of sensible data stored in the database.
- User management (creation, deletion, edition, profiles, privileges).
- Account password recovery by unique token sent via email.
- Search system.
- Product categories.
- Product showcase system (each product is shown as a card with a descriptive image(s), title and description).
- Customizable company info (can be changed, it's not hardcoded in the HTML template).
- In-site contact form.
- Search Engine Optimization.

Planned features:
- Basic UI customization (colors, images).
- Visitor counter (for administration purposes).
