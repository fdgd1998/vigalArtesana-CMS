# vigalArtesanos CMS
This is a small, custom CMS developed from scratch for my mother's carpentry and restoration company.

The main purpose of this CMS is to make something simple from scratch and easy to use, providing to the visitors company information and a product showcase where the work done can be exposed. A basic control panel is also made to manage website's content.

Programming languages: HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and MySQL.
Frameworks: bootstrap, jQuery.

Features:
- Encryption of sensible data stored in the database.
- User management (creation, deletion, edition, profiles, privileges).
- Account password recovery by unique token sent via email.
- Search system.
- Product categories.
- Product showcase system (each product is shown as a card with a descriptive image(s), title and description).
- Customizable company info (can be changed, it's not hardcoded into the HTML template).
- In-site contact form.
- Search Engine Optimization.

Planned features:
- UI customization (colors, template images).
- Visitor counter (for administration purposes).
